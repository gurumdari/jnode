Jnode Framework
======
Jnode Framework is a node based front-end development framework. You can partly develop your web application using HTML element nodes and JavaScript hierarchical object nodes based on the functions. In case of structured development of templates involving HTML, occasionally you can develop templates separately classified according to those features. Because when responding a client request, the web application engine generates a whole template file using its include function, divided source codes are simply combined and sent to the network as a whole template inefficiently. But this framework calls nodes and theirs subordinate components like templates, JavaScript and CSS files by actual necessity for rendering.
